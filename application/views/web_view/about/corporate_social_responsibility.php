That it should give back something in return is not only fair and righteous, but absolutely imperative for its own continuity. As captains of industry, acknowledging responsibility towards our immediate society and the environment at large is thus both a conscientious decision and a matter of informed choice. Corporate Social Responsibility has always been pivotal to TIL&rsquo;s aspirations for inclusive development. Over the years, we have undertaken numerous socially relevant initiatives and in our own small way tried to make a positive difference. We remain committed to the cause of CSR, not to be swayed or deterred by adversities, come what may.&rdquo;

Suffering from conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, joint pain and gastric problems – which have emerged, over the years, as the most common and predominant ailments – the beneficiaries are dependent on the Weekly Health Camp as their primary source of treatment.</p>
