                        court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability will not
                        affect the other provisions of these Terms of Use, all of which shall remain in full force and effect, and such
                        other provisions will be interpreted so as best to reasonably effect the intent of the parties. The parties
                        further agree to replace any such invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision
                        designed to achieve, to the extent possible under applicable law, the business purpose and intent of such
                        invalid or unenforceable provision. The laws of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
                        Sale of Goods shall not apply.
